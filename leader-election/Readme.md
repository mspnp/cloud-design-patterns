# Leader Election pattern example

This directory contains an example of the [Leader Election cloud design pattern](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/patterns/leader-election).

This example shows how a worker process can become a leader among a group of peer instances. The leader could then perform tasks that coordinate and control the other instances; these tasks should be performed by only one worker instance.

This example contains one project showing the implementation of a distributed mutex based on a storage blob lease, and another project showing a simple example worker process, implemented as a console app, that leverages the distributed mutex to ensure only one process runs the leader-specific code.

## :rocket: Deployment guide

Install the prerequisites and follow the steps to run the example and observe the leader election behavior.

### Prerequisites

- [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0)
- [Azurite emulator for local Azure Storage development](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-use-azurite) or an [Azure Storage Account](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-account-create)

#### Optional
- [Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 Community, Enterprise, or Professional](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with [C# for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csharp)

### Steps

1. Clone the repository

    Open a terminal, clone the repository, and navigate to the `leader-election` directory.

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/mspnp/cloud-design-patterns.git
    cd cloud-design-patterns
    cd leader-election
    ```

1. Build the solution

    Using the existing terminal window, build the solution.

    ```shell
    dotnet build
    ```

1. Select your storage

    #### Running with Azurite storage emulator

    The included `app.config` file is set up to use a local Azure Storage emulator. Open a new terminal window, navigate to an empty working directory for the Azurite data files, and start the emulator with the command `azurite`, or `npx azurite` if you installed via `npm`.

    #### Running with Azure Storage account

    Using the Azure portal, create a new Azure Storage account, or use an existing account.

    The sample defaults to use a container named `leases`. If you are utilizing an existing storage account, be certain that this container is not already in use.

    Find the connection string in your Storage Account's `Access keys` section in the portal. Copy the Connection string value from either key1 or key2 and replace the `StorageConnectionString` value field in `LeaderElectionConsoleWorker/app.config` with the copied value.

### :checkered_flag: Try it out

4. Running the worker process

    Navigate to the `leader-election/LeaderElectionConsoleWorker` directory, and start the application.

    ```shell
    cd LeaderElectionConsoleWorker
    dotnet run
    ```

    Ideally, you should start multiple instances of the worker process to see the coordination. To do this, open additional terminal windows or tabs, and run the same command. When a worker process is the leader, you will see periodic output like:

    ```output
    [14:22:30] This process (51635) is currently the leader. Press any key to exit.
    ```

    If a worker process is not the leader, you will see:

    ```output
    [14:23:21] This process (51686) could not acquire lease. Retrying in 20 seconds. Press any key to exit.
    ```

1. Observe leader election recovery

    You can terminate the current leader and watch one of the other worker processes acquire the lease and become the new leader:

    ```output
    [14:24:21] This process (51686) could not acquire lease. Retrying in 20 seconds. Press any key to exit.
    [14:24:41] This process (51686) could not acquire lease. Retrying in 20 seconds. Press any key to exit.
    [14:25:01] This process (51686) is currently the leader. Press any key to exit.
    ```

1. Run from multiple machines

    If you are using an Azure Storage account, you can run the worker process from multiple machines. Try running it on a second machine, and then temporarily disable or unplug the network on the machine that hosts the leader process. You will see that as the lease expires, one of the still-connected worker processes will claim the lease and assume the role of leader.

1. Observe detailed tracing

    You can use the [`dotnet-trace` tool](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/diagnostics/dotnet-trace) to observe detailed tracing information on the worker process as it attempts to acquire or renew the lease on the storage blob.

## :broom: Clean up resources

This example does not require the creation of any resources. If you created a new storage account in step 3, you should delete that account if you are no longer using it. If you used an existing storage account, you can delete the `leases` container that was used by this example.
