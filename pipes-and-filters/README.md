# Pipes and Filters pattern example

This directory contains an example of the [Pipes and Filters cloud design pattern](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/patterns/pipes-and-filters).

This example contains three filters that perform processing on an image. The three filters are combined into a pipe; the output of one filter is passed as the input to the next. The filters are implemented as separate Function App functions and storage queue is the pipe. While this pattern shows the Function App functions being co-located under the same Function App for simplicity, they could very well be deployed individually to support more per-filter autonomy/scale.

The sample takes a source image, resizes it (first filter), adds a watermark (second filter), then publishes it to a output destination (third filter). In this sample, the order of the first two filters could be reversed as they are not dependent on each other. The pipes are Azure Storage queues.

## :rocket: Deployment guide

Install the prerequisites and follow the steps to have deploy and run a example of the Pipes and Filters pattern.

### Prerequisites

- Permission to create a new resource group and resources in an [Azure subscription](https://azure.com/free).
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0)
- [Azure Functions Core Tools](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local#install-the-azure-functions-core-tools)
- [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)

### Steps

1. Clone this repository to your workstation and navigate to the working directory.

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/mspnp/cloud-design-patterns
   cd pipes-and-filters
   ```

1. Log into Azure and create an empty resource group.

   Please create an empty resource group to hold the resources for this example. The location you select in the resource group creation command below is the Azure region that your resources will be deployed in; adjust if needed.

   ```azurecli
   az login
   az account set -s <Name or ID of subscription>

   RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME=rg-pipes-and-filters
   az group create -n $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME -l eastus2
   ```

1. Deploy the storage account.

   This storage account contains the queues that will act as the pipe in this sample. This deployment will also configure your identity to be able to create blobs and add queue messages. The Azure Function app will run under your identity, and needs these permissions.

   ```azurecli
   CURRENT_USER_OBJECT_ID=$(az ad signed-in-user show -o tsv --query id)
   STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME="stpipe$(LC_ALL=C tr -dc 'a-z0-9' < /dev/urandom | fold -w 10 | head -n 1)"
   # This takes about one minute
   az deployment group create -n deploy-pipe -f bicep/main.bicep -g $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME -p storageAccountName=$STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME userObjectId=$CURRENT_USER_OBJECT_ID
   ```

1. Configure local Functions project to use the deployed Storage account.

   ```shell
   sed "s/STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME/${STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME}/g" ImageProcessingPipeline/local.settings.template.json > ImageProcessingPipeline/local.settings.json
   ```

1. Start the filters.

   The filters are running as individual functions, connected by the queues (pipes).

   **Run the following in a new terminal tab.**

   ```shell
   cd ImageProcessingPipeline
   func start
   ```

   From this terminal you can see trace messages from the functions executing and this is where you can terminate the function as well with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>c</kbd>.

1. Switch back to viewing your original terminal window once you see the output message "Host lock lease acquired by instance ID ..." indicating that the filters are ready to execute.

### :checkered_flag: Try it out

Now with your pipes deployed and filters ready to execute, it's time to send up a request for an image to be processed.

1. Open a sample image to see a "before" state.

   This repo has a sample image for you to see. Open images/clouds.png to see what the "before" image looks like. You'll notice it's larger than 600px wide and does not have a watermark on it.

   ![A picture of fluffy clouds in a blue sky](./images/clouds.png)

1. Upload a sample image to the storage account for processing through the pipes and filters.

   ```azurecli
   az storage blob upload -f images/clouds.png -c images --account-name $STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME --auth-mode login --overwrite true
   az storage message put --content "$(echo -n 'images/clouds.png' | base64)" -q pipe-xfty --account-name $STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME --auth-mode login
   ```

1. Observe the filter process.

   If you look at your function output, in your other terminal's tab, you should see log entries similar to the following, which shows the three filters being executed in series, with the final filter writing a copy of the file to the destination.

   ```output

   ```

1. Download the processed image.

   ```azurecli
   az storage blob download -f images/clouds-processed.png -c processed -n clouds.png --account-name $STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME --auth-mode login
   ```

1. Open **images/clouds-processed.png** to see the "after" state.

   You'll notice it's resized to 600px wide and has a watermark on it.

## :broom: Clean up resources

Be sure to delete Azure resources when not using them. Since all resources were deployed into a new resource group, you can simply delete the resource group.

```azurecli
az group delete -n $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME
```

## Deploying the functions to Azure

If you wish to deploy the Azure functions to Azure instead of running locally, ensure the Azure Function has a system-managed identity and that identity is granted blob and queue data contributor rights on the storage account.
