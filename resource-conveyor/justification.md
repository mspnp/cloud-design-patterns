# Justification for the Resource Conveyor Pattern

The **Resource Conveyor Pattern** is proposed to address a persistent challenge in cloud architectures — the management of long-running, non-managed external resources that degrade over time. Below are key arguments supporting the addition of this pattern to the existing catalog of cloud design patterns.

## 1. Innovation Value

The **Resource Conveyor** introduces a **novel approach** to managing long-lived, non-managed external resources. While there are existing solutions that address certain aspects of resource lifecycle management (such as the **Bulkhead** and **Circuit Breaker** patterns), the **Resource Conveyor** differentiates itself by offering a proactive approach to resource rotation.

- **Unique combination of features**: By rotating resources through three distinct phases (Preload, Active, Offload), the pattern ensures that resources are regularly refreshed, preventing performance degradation and memory leaks. This automatic, conveyor-style resource rotation is not addressed by existing patterns, making it a valuable addition to the catalog.

## 2. Problem Relevance

Managing long-running resources remains a **significant challenge** in cloud computing, especially for systems that rely on external libraries, browser instances, or API proxies. The problem persists even as trends shift towards serverless architectures, which often abstract away infrastructure concerns.

- **Relevance despite serverless trends**: Many cloud-native applications still rely on external, non-managed components that need careful lifecycle management. The **Resource Conveyor** provides a **comprehensive solution** for managing these resources in both traditional and cloud-native architectures.

## 3. Potential Impact

The **Resource Conveyor Pattern** has the potential to deliver significant improvements in **system stability** and **performance** by ensuring that resources are rotated before they degrade. While some concerns about added complexity and overhead may exist, these are outweighed by the pattern’s ability to mitigate more costly performance issues in resource-heavy environments.

- **Impact on system performance**: Rotating resources ensures they are never left running long enough to accumulate performance debt, memory leaks, or resource exhaustion.
- **Self-healing systems**: By integrating a proactive approach to resource management, the pattern reduces the need for manual interventions or complex error-recovery mechanisms.

## 4. Adaptability

The **Resource Conveyor** pattern is highly **adaptable** to a variety of cloud applications and infrastructures. The conveyor principles can be optimized to address specific **resource efficiency** concerns, such as adjusting the rotation interval based on resource usage or dynamically scaling the number of active resources based on workload.

- **Customizable for efficiency**: By tuning the conveyor timing and adapting it to the nature of the workload, the pattern can ensure that resources are efficiently managed without unnecessary overhead.

## 5. Completeness

Existing patterns like **Bulkhead**, **Competing Consumers**, and **Circuit Breaker** address **isolated aspects** of the problem, but they don’t offer a comprehensive lifecycle management strategy for non-managed resources. The **Resource Conveyor** offers a **complete solution** that proactively manages the lifecycle of resources, ensuring they are refreshed, utilized, and safely disposed of.

- **Proactive lifecycle management**: The conveyor ensures that resources are continuously refreshed, preventing long-term degradation. This is more comprehensive than other patterns that handle resource isolation or error recovery but do not deal with the root cause of resource exhaustion or slowdowns.

## 6. Proven Practical Application

The effectiveness of the **Resource Conveyor Pattern** has been demonstrated in a real-world scenario with the **Microsoft XSLT Transformation Library**, where it was used to mitigate memory leaks. The library incurs memory leaks when processing JavaScript code blocks within XSLT transformations due to the nature of long-running, non-managed resource handling.

- **Memory Leak Solution**: By applying the Resource Conveyor approach, where XSLT processors were rotated through **Preload**, **Active**, and **Offload** states, memory leaks were effectively managed, improving both stability and performance in a system known for memory-intensive operations.
  
- **System-Level Implementation**: This pattern was crucial in environments where there were **no feasible alternatives** for managing persistent memory issues. It was easily implemented at the **system level** by rotating **AppDomains**, which effectively **flushed out wasted persistent memory** that would have otherwise degraded performance over time.

This concrete example showcases the **robustness** and **efficiency** of the pattern, providing proof that the pattern can solve complex memory management challenges in high-demand environments. The **simplicity of its implementation** across different systems further solidifies its utility. This practical success serves as an additional layer of validation for including the pattern in the official catalog.


## Conclusion

The **Resource Conveyor Pattern** addresses a clear gap in cloud design patterns by providing a novel, adaptable, and comprehensive approach to managing long-lived external resources. Its potential impact on system stability and performance, combined with its adaptability and focus on lifecycle management, make it a strong candidate for inclusion in the cloud design pattern catalog.
