# Priority Queue Pattern

This document describes the Priority Queue Pattern example from the guide [Cloud Design Patterns](http://aka.ms/Cloud-Design-Patterns).

## System Requirements

* Microsoft .NET Core 3.1
* Microsoft Visual Studio 2019
* Windows Azure SDK for .NET version 3.1

## Before you start

Ensure that you have installed all of the software prerequisites.

The example demonstrates operational aspects of applications running in Windows Azure. Therefore, you will need to use the monitoring tools in order to understand how the code sample works. You **must** ensure that the Azure Functions in the solution are configured to use the diagnostics mechanism. If not, you will not see the trace information generated by the example.

## About the Example

This example shows how you can implement priority queues by using Service Bus Topics and Subscriptions. A timer triggered Azure Function is responsible for sending messages to a topic. It assigns a priority to each message. The receiving Azure Functions read messages from subscriptions that have the corresponding priority. In the example, The PriorityQueueConsumerHigh Azure function can scale out to 200 instances, whereas the PriorityQueueConsumerLow worker runs only with one instance. This ensures that high priority messages are read from the queue more quickly than low priority messages.

## Running the Example

You can run this example locally in the Visual Studio Windows Azure emulator. You can also run this example by deploying it to a Function App Service.

* Provision a Windows Azure Service Bus Namespace
* Start Visual Studio using an account that has Administrator privileges ("Run as Administrator").
* Open the solution you want to explore from the subfolders where you downloaded the examples.
* Edit the local.settings.json file in all the projects and change the ServiceBusConnectionString setting by changing the placeholders "[your namespace]" and "[your secret]" to your own values.

* If you want to run the example in the local Windows Azure emulator:
	* Set the PriorityQueueSender project as startup.
	* Press F5 in Visual Studio to start the example running. The function will start sending messages to the topic, every 30 seconds.
	* Stop the execution, change the startup project to either the PriorityQueueConsumerHigh or PriorityQueueConsumerLow
	* Press F5 in Visual Studio to start the execution of the consumer function
	* In the Azure Functions Core Tools Console, you can view the diagnostic information generated by Trace statements in the code.

* If you want to run the example on Windows Azure:
	* On every function project. Right click on it and select publish.
	* Select "Azure" as publishing target.
	* Select "Azure Function App" as specific target.
	* In the Functions instance step, select you Azure Function app or create a new one using the link button.
	* Since your app settings are different you need to deploy every Azure Function in a separate Azure Funcion App.
	* You can select an existing resource group and storage account or create new ones.
	* In "Hosting" section, click on the the three dots (...) in the upper right corner.
	* Select "Manage Azure App Service Settings".
	* You need to add this three settings:
	  - ServiceBusConnectionString:

	  		You can get this value from the Azure Portal. Go to the Service Bus Namespace in your resource group in find the primary 
			connection under "Shared Access Policies", set the app setting's remote value to the value you copied from the portal.

	  - TopincName:

	  		Set the remote value to "topic_1"

	  - WEBSITE_MAX_DYNAMIC_APPLICATION_SCALE_OUT:

	  		This setting sepcifies how many instances the functions on your app service consumption can scale out to.
			For the "PriorityQueueConsumerLow" function set the remote value to 1
			For the other functions set it explicitly to the default: 200 (This ensures that high priority messages are read from the queue more quickly than low priority messages).

	* Once the Functions are deployed you can configure monitoring by following these steps:

		- From the Azure Portal, go to the Function App Service
		- Click on "Functions" and select the azure function
		- From the "developer" left menu click on "Monitor"
		- Turn on application insights
		- Refresh the screen
		- Once refreshed you will see two tabs, "invocation" and "logs"
		- From the invocations tab you can see the twenty most recent function invocation traces. For more advanced analysis, run the query in Application Insights. 
		- From the logs tab you can see the logging information that your functions are sending.
