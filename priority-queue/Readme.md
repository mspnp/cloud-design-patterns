# Priority Queue Pattern

This document describes the Priority Queue Pattern example from the guide [Cloud Design Patterns](http://aka.ms/Cloud-Design-Patterns).

## System Requirements

* Microsoft .NET 6
* Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 or later version
* Azure Functions Core Tools version 4x

## Before you start

Ensure that you have installed all of the software prerequisites.

The example demonstrates operational aspects of applications running in Windows Azure. Therefore, you will need to use the monitoring tools in order to understand how the code sample works. You **must** ensure that the Azure Functions in the solution are configured to use the diagnostics mechanism. If not, you will not see the trace information generated by the example.

## About the Example

This example shows how you can implement priority queues by using Service Bus Topics and Subscriptions. A timer triggered Azure Function is responsible for sending messages to a topic. It assigns a priority to each message. The receiving Azure Functions read messages from subscriptions that have the corresponding priority. In the example, the PriorityQueueConsumerHigh Azure function can scale out to 200 instances, whereas the PriorityQueueConsumerLow worker runs only with one instance. This simulates high priority messages being read from the queue more urgently than low priority messages.

## Running the Example

You can either run this example locally in the Visual Studio Windows Azure emulator or you can run it by deploying it to Function App Services.

* Provision an Azure Service Bus Namespace.
* Start Visual Studio.
* Open the solution you want to explore from the subfolders where you downloaded the examples.
* Edit the local.settings.json file in all the projects and change the ServiceBusConnection__fullyQualifiedNamespace setting by changing the placeholder "<service_bus_namespace>"  to your Azure Service Bus Namespace name.

* If you want to run the example in the local Windows Azure emulator:
	* Set the PriorityQueueSender project as startup.
	* Press F5 in Visual Studio to start the example running. The function will start sending messages to the topic, every 30 seconds.
	* Stop the execution, change the startup project to either the PriorityQueueConsumerHigh or PriorityQueueConsumerLow
	* Press F5 in Visual Studio to start the execution of the consumer function
	* In the Azure Functions Core Tools Console, you can view the diagnostic information generated by Trace statements in the code.

* If you want to run the example on Windows Azure:
	* On every function project, right click and select publish.
	* Select "Azure" as publishing target.
	* Select "Azure Function App" as specific target.
	* In the Functions instance step, select you Azure Function app or create a new one using the link button.
	* Since your app settings are different you need to deploy every Azure Function in a separate Azure Funcion App.
	* You can select an existing resource group and storage account or create new ones.
	* In "Hosting" section, click on the the three dots (...) in the upper right corner.
	* Select "Manage Azure App Service Settings".
	* You need to add these two settings:

	  - ServiceBusConnection__fullyQualifiedNamespace:

			Set the value to:

	  		<service_bus_namespace>.servicebus.windows.net

			Replacing the placeholder with you Azure Service Bus Namespace name.

	  - WEBSITE_MAX_DYNAMIC_APPLICATION_SCALE_OUT:

	  		This setting specifies how many instances the functions on your app service consumption can scale out to.
			For the "PriorityQueueConsumerLow" function set the remote value to 1
			For the other functions set it explicitly to the default: 200 (This ensures that high priority messages are read from the queue more quickly than low priority messages).

	* Once the Functions are deployed you can configure the managed identities role assignments:

			In the Azure portal, navigate to the Azure Service Bus Namespace that was provisioned in the first step.
			Select Access Control (IAM). This is where you can view and configure who has access to the resource.
			Click Add and select add role assignment.
			From the list, select "Azure Service Bus Data Sender", click Next
			In "Assign access to", radio button list, select "Managed identity"
			Click on "Select members", the "Select Manage identities" dialog will show up
			In the Managed Identity  dropdown list select "Function App"
			Find the PriorityQueueSender function app click on it
			Click "Select"
			On the main dialog, click "Review + Assign"

			For the Azure Conumer Function Apps, repeat the process but in this case use the role
			"Azure Service Bus Data Reader"

	* Once the Functions are deployed you can configure monitoring by following these steps:

		- From the Azure Portal, go to the Function App Service
		- Click on "Functions" and select the azure function
		- From the "developer" left menu click on "Monitor"
		- Turn on application insights
		- Refresh the screen
		- Once refreshed you will see two tabs, "invocation" and "logs"
		- From the invocations tab you can see the twenty most recent function invocation traces. For more advanced analysis, run the query in Application Insights. 
		- From the logs tab you can see the logging information that your functions are sending.
